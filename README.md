Mary was a young, beautiful goat living on Elocin’s goat farm.  With only 50 goats, it was a small goat farm, unlike Rosie’s goat farm, which had 100 goats (100 more than she could handle, being preoccupied with Yoga all the time), or Chris’s goat farm which had 150 goats (who were all very smart, and helped him study for his Engineering classes), or Brian the Goatslaughterer’s goat farm, which surprisingly maintained an immense number of goats despite Brian’s chop-happy habits.

Like any other goat, Mary loved to frolic in the meadows, to butt heads with her other goat friends, and to relax by the fence, looking towards the world outside the farm and wondering.

Most of all, Mary enjoyed spending time with her human friend Jacqueline.  Jacqueline worked on Elocin’s farm, humbly gathering bundles of hay for the goats and other farm animals to eat.

Jacqueline would tell Mary stories of her life, the things she would do when not working bundling the hay.  She would talk about her adventures in Greece, the stories she’s read about superheroes and zombies, and of strange tournaments where people would travel from all over the world to push buttons that make moving pictures of people on a giant screen attack each other.
